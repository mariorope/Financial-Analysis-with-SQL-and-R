# Financial-Analysis-with-SQL-and-R
In this project, it was used data from a national hospital cost survey conducted by the US Agency for Healthcare that consists of hospital records of inpatient samples. The data provided are restricted to the city of Wisconsin and refer to patients aged 0 to 17 years.
This project was separated into two steps. In step 1 we explored the data using SQL Language and answered 10 business questions. In step 2 we carried out statistical analysis with the R language using the ANOVA Test and Linear Regression and answered 7 business questions.
The dataset was generated from the sources below:
https://www.cms.gov/Research-Statistics-Data-and-Systems/Statistics-Trends-and-Reports/Medicare-Provider-Cost-Report/HospitalCostPUF
https://healthdata.gov/

Below are the questions that were answered in the exploratory data analysis with SQL Language:
1- How many races are represented in the dataset?
2- What is the average age of patients?
3- What is the age mode of the patients?
4- What is the variance of the age variable?
5- What is the total expenditure on hospital admissions by age?
6- What age generates the highest total expenditure on hospital admissions?
7- What is the total expenditure on hospital admissions by gender?
8- What is the average expenditure on hospital admissions by patient race?
9- For patients over 10 years old, what is the average total expenditure on hospitalizations?
10- Considering the previous item, which age has an average spending greater than 3000?

Below are the questions that were answered in the statistical analysis using R:
1- What is the age distribution of patients attending the hospital?
2- Which age group has the highest total expenditure in the hospital?
3- Which group based on diagnosis (Aprdrg) has the highest total expenditure in the hospital?
4- Is the patient's race related to the total amount spent on hospital admissions?
5- The combination of age and gender of patients influences the total expenditure on hospitalizations
at the hospital?
6- As the length of stay is a crucial factor for hospitalized patients, we wish to find out whether length of stay can be predicted from age, gender, and race.
7- Which variables have the greatest impact on hospitalization costs?
